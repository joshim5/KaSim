(******************************************************************************
* Strong compression algorithm
* This strong compression matching algorithm matches a particular type of 
* abstract stories to the trace it might represent. In particular, a strong 
* compression matching is valid if there is some mapping from the story's 
* agents in its instantiations to the trace's agents such that the 
* instantiations are valid. 
* This matching algorithm is a nondeterministic backwards version of the
* matching algorithm above. When a story's event can potentially be mapped
* to a trace's event, a version of the current state (wq, result_map, is_done)
* is created to represent this mapping, and another version is maintained that
* does not make this mapping.
* When a mapping is made, mappings between agents from the story and agents 
* from the trace that were made in previous steps must be maintained. To 
* achieve this, we maintain an additional data structure capturing the
* current agent identifier concretization, and make sure each step of the
* algorithm preserves that.
* 
* Known issues: 
* Right now the mapping between agent identifiers in a story's event and
* trace's event is constructed simply by taking the set of agents in a particular
* story event, and the set of agents in a particular trace event, and
* choosing a matching between them that preserves the current concretization and
* rule types. However, the assignment of agents to their concretizations will need 
* to be better:
* 1. More than just checking whether a mapping btwn agents exists, you need to
* check that the appropriate tests are applied to the appropriate agents.
* 2. Need to account for this case: multiple agents of type A in a rule, such 
* that a single story event could yield multiple potential new matches in an
* exponential way. _All possible_ valid mappings.
